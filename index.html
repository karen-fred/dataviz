    <h1>Karen Petree's Data Visualization Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Mapping Inflation in Latin America</h2>
    <p>I created this visualization as part of a course called <em>Advanced Data Journalism: Powerful data reporting and mapping tools</em>
        at the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas. The BOC was led by John Keefe.</p>

    <h2>My Travels</h2>
    <p>This is just a fun map I created for myself to chart my world travels. I made a spreadsheet in Google Sheets and linked it to the map so as I update the spreadsheet, which I hopefully will very soon, the map will update.</p>
